This repository is sep up as appendix of my master's thesis at TU Dresden, which was submitted on February 15, 2021.
The following documents are contained

- An R script providing the raw code of data analysis
- An Rmarkdown document, that is the basis of the knitted .html document
- A knitted html document for inspection of the detailed data analysis outputs
- An .xls file (studies) containing information about included primary studies
- An .xls file (dataset) containing the collected raw data from the primary studies
- An .xls file (effectsizes) containing the calculated effect sizes which are the basis of the multilevel meta-analysis
- An empty .xlsx file (effsize_calc) that was used for effect size calculation. Two columns identify the respective baseline and NDT conditions to be compared
